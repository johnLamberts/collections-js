# Stack

In computer science, a **stack** is an abstract data type that servers as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

- **push** - adds an element to the collection.

- **pop** - removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements came off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, **_LIFE_** (_Last In, Last Out_). Additionally, a _peek_ operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.

The name "_stack_" for this type of data structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other, which makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require other items first.
